//A Promise is like a guarantee or commitment that something will happen â€” either:
//It succeeds (resolved) or
//It fails (rejected)
//Promises help JavaScript manage tasks that take time, like:
//Fetching data from a server (network requests), Reading a file, Waiting for a timer etc
//A Promise gives us a way to run code later, when the task finishes
//A Promise is a way for JavaScript to handle future events: either success (resolve) or failure (reject)
//async/await is actually built on top of Promises
//So whenever we use await something, behind the scenes it's dealing with a Promise

/*
A Promise can be in three states:
State	                Meaning
.....                   ....... 
Pending	                The task is still running (not finished yet)
Resolved (Fulfilled)	The task finished successfully
Rejected	            The task failed
*/
